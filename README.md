# Java-Attack-on-Titans-Game

Tower Defence game I created using Java and JavaFX, inspired by the amazing show of Attack on Titan! This game challenged me to bring together creative design and solid programming skills to build an engaging and visually dynamic experience.

Core Mechanics:
-Strategically deploy weapons along multiple lanes to fend off waves of Titans.
-Enemies increase in strength and numbers as the game progresses.
-Earn resources from each defeated Titan to unlock and upgrade defenses.
-The game concludes when all towers fall, with a final score highlighting your performance.

Key Features:
-A variety of weapon types and Titan enemies, each with distinct behaviors and abilities.
-A custom 2D graphical interface using JavaFX, featuring animated sprites and smooth interactions.
-Real-time difficulty scaling and strategic resource allocation to maintain gameplay balance.

Technical Highlights:
-Leveraged object-oriented programming to create clean, scalable code structures.
-Built a responsive JavaFX GUI with interactive elements and animation handling.
-Developed systems for wave generation, resource tracking, scoring, and game state management.
-Enhanced debugging techniques and optimized rendering performance.
